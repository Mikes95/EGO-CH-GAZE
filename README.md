This is the official github repository related to the "Learning to Detect Attended Objects in Cultural Sites with Gaze Signals and Weak Object Supervision"


To study the problem of attended object detection in cultural sites, we collected and labeled a dataset of egocentric images acquired from subjects visiting a cultural site. The dataset has been designed to offer a snapshot of the subjectâ€™s visual experience while visiting a museum and contains labels for several artworks and details attended by the subjects.
We propose two new approaches to tackle attended object detection at the different weakly supervised levels, which offer the best trade-off in terms of performance and needed amount of supervision, as shown in our experiments. Specifically, we propose a box coordinates regressor algorithm which can be trained when bounding boxes around attended objects are available and a weakly supervised attended object detection approach which can be used when only the attended object class is available as a form of supervision
